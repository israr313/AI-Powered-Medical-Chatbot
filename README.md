AI-Powered Medical Chatbot
This project is an AI-Powered Medical Chatbot designed to provide accurate and reliable responses to medical-related queries. It leverages advanced NLP models and integrates Groq API for enhanced capabilities. Key features include intent classification, text preprocessing, and a Gradio-based interactive interface. The chatbot processes user inputs, identifies the intent, and generates appropriate medical responses by comparing embeddings. Built with Python, Transformers, and Torch, it aims to simplify access to medical information. Future plans include expanding the dataset and integrating multilingual support.
